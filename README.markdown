This is my custom vim installation. I've tested it over Ubuntu only.

## Installation

Some of the plugins on this vim package require that you have Vim compiled with Lua scripting enabled.

If you are in a Mac, you just have to do

    brew install vim --with-lua
    or
    brew install macvim --with-lua

I am afraid on Ubuntu/Linux you will have to download vim from source and enable the Lua option on the makefile. Yeah, I know. Sucks.

Make sure you have git, bash, grep and curl installed in your machine before attempting to install this.

    sudo apt-get install git bash grep curl
    or
    brew install git bash grep curl

Once the prerequisites are satisfied, install Adegan by executing this command:

    curl -Lo- https://raw.github.com/kikito/adegan/master/scripts/bootstrap.sh | bash


## Credits

I've included lots of plugins using pathogen: http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen

I'm using a good amount of pathogen plugins on this distribution; you may find the complete list inside the /bundle/ directory.

Some of the scripts inside the /scripts/ directory, as well as lots of settins inside the vimrc file, are inspired by janus:
